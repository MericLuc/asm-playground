# x64 Assembly playground

This repository contains some experiments on x64 assembly programming,
which is the langage of Intel and AMD CPU's used in most PCs.

Do not look for fancy programs as this repository is intended for : 
- having fun !
- trying to get to know my CPU a bit better
- get better insights about what is going on when developping programs with high-level langages.
